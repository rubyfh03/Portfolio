                    <h1>Hi! I'm Ruby Hammond</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a second-year Computer Information Technology (CIT) student at Lethbridge Polytechnic. 
                        My journey to this point has been anything but conventional. I was born and raised in the picturesque mountains of Salmo, BC—a small village where technology felt like a distant world. 
                        Growing up, I knew little about computers, networks, or even Wi-Fi, but I’ve come a long way, and I’m so glad I chose this path. 
                        <br>
                        Outside of school, I work as a respite care aide,
                        supporting individuals with special abilities. This 
                        work has been incredibly rewarding—it’s a constant 
                        reminder of the beauty of human connection, and 
                        the light they bring into my life inspires me every day.
